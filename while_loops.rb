# ------------------------ WHILE LOOPS

# specify a condition
# while the condition is true, keep looping



# while the index is less than or equal to five,
# keep incrementing inside the while loop
index = 1
while index <= 5
  puts index
  index += 1
end
# basically we're saying
# while index is less than 5
# increment up from index 1 until index is equal to 5


# AVOID INFINITE LOOPS
