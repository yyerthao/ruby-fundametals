# Donâ€™t put spaces between method names and opening parentheses in the first place.
# The cause of the error one cannot add numbers to strings, ruby prevents implicit coercion. One might use string interpolation:
# puts "this is number: #{num}"
# or convert the number to string explicitly:
# puts("this is number: " + num.to_s)
